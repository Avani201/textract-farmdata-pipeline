# Textract Farm Data Pipeline
This AWS Lambda (Python) script automates OCR and data extraction for 19th-century U.S. agricultural census pages. 

It uses Amazon Textract and S3 to detect text, merge continuation lines, and export standardized CSVs for analysis.

Developed for my research assistant work digitizing historical farm data under Professor Hoyt Bleakley at the University of Michigan. 

This project demonstrates skills in cloud automation, data cleaning, and text parsing for empirical economic research.
